### Required Azure DevOps REST API Endpoints for ADO Management Desktop App

As a systems engineer specializing in Azure DevOps (ADO) integrations with Angular 17 and Tauri applications, I've compiled a comprehensive, organized list of the exact API endpoints needed based on your project's functional areas (as outlined in the provided requirements). This is drawn from the latest Azure DevOps REST API reference (version 7.2 as of February 2025). All endpoints follow the standard structure: `https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/{area}/{resource}?api-version=7.2` (omit `{project}` for organization-level calls). I've grouped them by your project's sections for clarity, including HTTP methods, brief usage notes, and integration tips for Angular/Tauri (e.g., using HttpClient in Angular for requests and Tauri's secure storage for auth headers).

I've used a table format per section for readability, focusing on endpoints that directly support your needs. Authentication uses PATs or OAuth in headers (e.g., `Authorization: Basic {base64(PAT)}`). For Angular 17, leverage standalone services with injectors for API calls; in Tauri, use the http plugin for Rust-side requests to handle offline caching.

#### 1. Authentication & Authorization APIs
These endpoints handle auth validation, user context, and access listing. No direct "refresh" endpoint for PATsâ€”implement expiration checks client-side.

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Angular/Tauri Integration Tip |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| /_apis/projects | GET | Validate PAT (lightweight check; returns 401 if invalid) | Use as an initial ping in Tauri's init script; Angular: HttpClient.get with error handling. |
| /_apis/accounts | GET | List user organizations (add ?ownerId={userId} for filtering) | Bind to Angular dropdown for org selection; cache in Tauri store. |
| /_apis/projects | GET | List projects within an organization | Similar to above; use for project picker in UI. |
| /_apis/profile/profiles/me | GET | Get current user details | Fetch profile for personalization; store in Angular NgRx state. |
| /_apis/security/permissions | GET | Get user permissions (namespace-specific) | Check scopes for role-based access in app (e.g., dev vs. manager views). |

#### 2. User Tab APIs (Personal Productivity)
Focus on personalized work items and notifications. Use WIQL for advanced filters in "My Tasks" and "My History".

#### 6. MCP Chatbot Integration APIs
No ADO endpoints hereâ€”this is custom. Use local POST to your MCP server (e.g., http://localhost:port/query) for NLP, then map responses to the above ADO endpoints (e.g., parse to WIQL calls). In Angular, use a chat component with RxJS for streaming; Tauri handles local server proxy.

#### 7. System Integration APIs (Tauri Backend)
Tauri-native (no ADO APIs). Use plugins like store for PATs, notification for trays, fs for files, updater for auto-updates. Cache ADO responses in local DB (e.g., Tauri's SQL plugin).

#### 8. Performance & Caching APIs
ADO supports these via query params (e.g., $top/$skip for pagination) and headers (ETag/If-Modified-Since). For real-time:
- /_apis/hooks/subscriptions (POST/GET) for webhooks.
No native SignalR; implement polling in Tauri or webhooks to a listener endpoint.

This organization covers all your needs end-to-end. For Angular 17 implementation, create a shared ApiService with interceptors for auth and versioning; in Tauri, bridge to Rust for secure, async calls. If you need code samples (e.g., an Angular service for WIT endpoints), let me know!
